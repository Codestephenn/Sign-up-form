# Odin Signup Form

This project implements a responsive signup form for Odin, a fictional online service. The form is designed to be aesthetically pleasing and functional, with a custom font and a background image.

## Features

- **Custom Font**: Utilizes the 'Norse Bold' font for the header to give a unique look.
- **Responsive Design**: The form layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Background Image**: A full-screen background image with an overlay to highlight the signup form.
- **Photo Credit**: Displays the credit for the background image at the bottom of the image container.
- **Form Validation**: Basic client-side validation for required fields and matching passwords.
- **Interactive Elements**: Styled buttons and input fields with focus and hover effects.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the signup form.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file with styles for the form, including media queries for responsiveness.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/odin-signup-form.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd odin-signup-form
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the form.

## Customization

- **Font**: The custom font is located in the `fonts` directory. You can replace it with your preferred font by updating the `@font-face` rule in `styles.css`.
- **Background Image**: Replace `bg.jpg` in the root directory with your desired background image. Ensure the path in the `image-container` CSS class is updated accordingly.
- **Photo Credit**: Update the links and text in the `photo-credit` div within `index.html` to reflect the correct credits for your background image.
